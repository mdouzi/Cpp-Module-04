C++ Module 04
This repository contains my solutions for C++ Module 04 at 42 Network (1337). The module focuses on Polymorphism and Advanced Class Concepts.

Overall Purpose:

To deepen our understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ through advanced class concepts like:

Virtual keyword and Polymorphism: Implementing dynamic binding through virtual functions and exploring its benefits.
Deep copy vs. Shallow copy: Understanding the difference between copying object data versus references and when each is appropriate.
Abstract classes and Interfaces: Defining abstract classes with pure virtual functions and utilizing interfaces to achieve flexible and robust code design.
Exercises:

The repository contains solutions for the following exercises:

Ex00: Polymorphism: Demonstrate dynamic binding with virtual functions using different shapes and their specific area calculation methods.
Ex01: Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy: Implement deep and shallow copy for a class containing nested objects and observe the difference in behavior.
Ex02: Abstract Classes: Define an abstract shape class with pure virtual functions for area calculation and then create concrete subclasses for specific shapes like rectangle and triangle.
Ex03: Interfaces: Develop an interface for drawing shapes and implement it in the concrete shape classes to achieve flexible drawing functionality.
Bonus Exercises (Optional): Additional exercises to further explore and practice the learned concepts.
Conceptual Explanations:

Each exercise folder includes a comment section explaining the purpose and key concepts involved. These explanations focus on the theoretical background and reasoning behind the code decisions, without going into detailed code descriptions.

Note:

This readme focuses on providing a high-level overview of the concepts and purpose of each exercise. 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss the concepts further!

Happy coding!
