## C++ Module 04: Polymorphism and Advanced Class Concepts

**Overview:**

This repository contains solutions for C++ Module 04 at 42 Network (1337), focusing on **Polymorphism and Advanced Class Concepts**. Through these exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++ by exploring:

* **Virtual keyword and Polymorphism:** Leverage dynamic binding through virtual functions to achieve flexible and powerful code design.
* **Deep copy vs. Shallow copy:** Master the difference between copying object data and references to ensure proper data management.
* **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Define abstract classes with pure virtual functions and utilize interfaces for robust and adaptable code structures.

**Exercises:**

Each exercise folder tackles a specific concept and includes solutions for the following:

* **Ex00: Polymorphism:** Implement dynamic binding with shapes and their area calculation methods, showcasing the power of virtual functions.
* **Ex01: Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy:** Deep dive into copying strategies for classes with nested objects, understanding the implications of each approach.
* **Ex02: Abstract Classes:** Define an abstract shape class with pure virtual functions for area calculation and then create concrete subclasses for specific shapes like rectangle and triangle.
* **Ex03: Interfaces:** Develop an interface for drawing shapes and implement it in concrete shape classes, enabling flexible drawing functionality.

**Additional Resources:**

* Official C++ Documentation: https://cplusplus.com/reference/(http://cppreference.com/)
* 42 Network C++ Resources: https://github.com/42YerevanProjects/cpp_modules
* Online tutorials on C++ Polymorphism, Deep Copy, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces.

**Note:**

This readme provides a high-level overview of the concepts and purpose of each exercise.

**Happy coding!**
